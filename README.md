A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. It is a form of generalized feed forward network that has internal memory which can be used to process the input data.
Here, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed and trained on S&P 500 data. The model is tested by predicting the next one,two,three or four values using a sliding sampling window of width 180 days.

The models are also re-tested on noise-corrupted data to observe the performance. The goal  is to optimize the RNN to give the best possible results.
